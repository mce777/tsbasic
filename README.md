##A simple TypeScript starter project
TypeScript is a dependency (see package.json for configuration details) and not installed globally. Therefore, a module bundler is required, like Webpack or this one here: https://github.com/paeckchen/paeckchen

With that configured, run this from the command line:

**npm run build**
